  (Use -temptrans to inhibit warning)

replace.c: (in function replaceAndWrite)
replace.c:39:25: Passed storage headPcline not completely defined (*headPcline
                    is undefined): Str_copy (headPcline, ...)
  Storage derivable from a parameter, return value or global is not defined.
  Use /*@out@*/ to denote passed or returned storage which need not be defined.
  (Use -compdef to inhibit warning)
replace.c:40:25: Passed storage tailPcline not completely defined (*tailPcline
                    is undefined): Str_copy (tailPcline, ...)
replace.c:41:28: New fresh storage (type char *) passed as implicitly temp (not
                    released): Str_concat(headPcline, pcTo)
  A memory leak has been detected. Storage allocated locally is not released
  before the last reference to it is lost. (Use -mustfreefresh to inhibit
  warning)
replace.c:42:28: New fresh storage (type char *) passed as implicitly temp (not
                    released): Str_concat(headPcline, pcTo)
replace.c:47:23: Fresh storage pcContain not released before return
   replace.c:37:10: Fresh storage pcContain created



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express

write "None."

NONE


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

it is possible ， because we just need to use assert to compare 
the value of length both distination value  and source value.
